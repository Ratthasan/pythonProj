'''Write a function named average() that has two parameters named num1 and num2.

The function should return the average of these two numbers.

Hint
To calculate the average of two numbers we add the first and second number, then divide the result by 2: (first + second) / 2'''

def average(num1,num2):
    return (num1+num2)/2


print(average(10,5))
